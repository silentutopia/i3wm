This space in the internet holds my i3wm and i3blocks dotfiles
Also has my somehow working scripts for i3wm

The theme changing script 'theme_control.sh' is located in /i3 directory
The script overwrites the original 
1]  i3 config
2]  i3blocks.conf
3]wallpaper
with dark or light config files and wallpapers as specified

the script refreshes the i3window manager, and the wallpaper is updated by 'feh' command the last line in the i3 'config' file


My directory structure is

home
├── i3
│   ├── config
│   ├── config.dark
│   ├── config.light
│   └── theme_control.sh
└── .i3blocks
│   ├── .i3blocks.conf.dark
│   └── .i3blocks.conf.dark
├───.i3blocks.cons
└───nzcustom├
    ├── wallpaper.jpeg
    ├── wallpaper_dark.jpeg
    └── wallpaper_light.jpeg











Known bug- Borders of existing windows may disappear when theme is changed (this also happens when i3 is reloaded)
          I don't use titlebars and hence haven't encountered this problem
